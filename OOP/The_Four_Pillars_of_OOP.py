# The four pillars of OOP.
# 1. Encapsulation-It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work with data within one unit.
# 2. Abstraction-Abstraction is one of the important principles of object-oriented programming.
# It refers to a programming approach by which only the relevant data about an object is exposed,
# hiding all the other details.
# This approach helps in reducing the complexity and increasing the efficiency of application development.
# 3. Inheritance
# 4. Polymorphism

# Python program showing
# abstract base class work
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
#
#
# class Polygon(ABC):
#
#     @abstractmethod
#     def no_of_sides(self):
#         pass
#
#
# class Triangle(Polygon):
#
#     # overriding abstract method
#     def no_of_sides(self):
#         print("I have 3 sides")


# class Pentagon(Polygon):
#
#     # overriding abstract method
#     def no_of_sides(self):
#         print("I have 5 sides")
#
#
# class Hexagon(Polygon):
#
#     # overriding abstract method
#     def no_of_sides(self):
#         print("I have 6 sides")
#
#
# class Quadrilateral(Polygon):
#
#     # overriding abstract method
#     def no_of_sides(self):
#         print("I have 4 sides")
#
#
# # Driver code
# R = Triangle()
# R.no_of_sides()
#
# K = Quadrilateral()
# K.no_of_sides()
#
# R = Pentagon()
# R.no_of_sides()
#
# K = Hexagon()
# K.no_of_sides()

# 3 Inheritance
